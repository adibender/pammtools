\title{Plot 1D (smooth) effects}
\usage{
gg_slice(data, model, term, ..., reference = NULL, ci = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data used to fit the \code{model}.}

\item{model}{A suitable model object which will be used to estimate the
partial effect of \code{term}.}

\item{term}{A character string indicating the model term for which partial
effects should be plotted.}

\item{...}{Covariate specifications (expressions) that will be evaluated
by looking for variables in \code{x}. Must be of the form \code{z = f(z)}
where \code{z} is a variable in the data set and \code{f} a known
function that can be usefully applied to \code{z}. Note that this is also
necessary for single value specifications (e.g. \code{age = c(50)}).
For data in PED (piece-wise exponential data) format, one can also specify
the time argument, but see "Details" an "Examples" below.}

\item{reference}{If specified, should be a list with covariate value pairs,
e.g. \code{list(x1 = 1, x2=50)}. The calculated partial effect will be relative
to an observation specified in \code{reference}.}

\item{ci}{Logical. Indicates if confidence intervals for the \code{term}
of interest should be calculated/plotted. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\description{
Flexible, high-level plotting function for (non-linear) effects conditional
on further covariate specifications and potentially relative to
a comparison specification.
