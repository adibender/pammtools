Description: The Piece-wise exponential (Additive Mixed) Model
    (PAMM; Bender and Scheipl (2018) <doi: 10.1177/1471082X17748083>) is a
    powerful model class for survival analysis, based on Generalized Additive
    (Mixed) Models (GA(M)Ms). It offers intuitive specification and robust
    estimation of complex survival models with stratified baseline hazards,
    random effects, time-varying effects, time-dependent covariates and
    cumulative effects (Bender et. al. (2018) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxy003>.
    pammtools provides tidy workflow for survival analysis with PAMMs,
    including data transformation and other pre- and post-processing
    functions as well as visualization.
